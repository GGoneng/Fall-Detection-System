# 📌 Project Title

> ### **Fall Detection System**



<br><br>
## 📖 Overview

This system is designed to rapidly detect falls, especially among the elderly population, and immediately notify caregivers to enable prompt response and intervention.  
Unlike typical vision-based approaches, it detects falls **without any wearable sensors**, using only a camera module.
The system extracts skeleton keypoints and treats them as time-series data—similar to gyroscope readings—enabling fall detection through temporal analysis rather than standard image classification.  
A functional prototype was also implemented and deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-world demonstration.
